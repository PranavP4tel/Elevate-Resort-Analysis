# Elevate-Resort-Analysis
Worked on the Elevate Resort Dataset to create a comprehensive report, evaluating the business by various factors and aspects, using Power BI.
Applied a lot of the learnings from my previous project, focused on the hospitality industry - https://github.com/PranavP4tel/Hospitality-Analysis-PowerBI

### Measures and calculations created using DAX:
1. Revenue and YoY percent change.
2. Realisation and YoY percent change.
3. ADR and YoY percent change.
4. DBRN and YoY percent change.
5. DURN and YoY percent change.
6. Total Bookings, Cancelled Bookings, No Shows and YoY % change for them.
7. Revenue from successful bookings, losses from cancellations and YoY % change for them.

### Workflow:
1. Data Loading & Transformation - Evaluated the data quality and removed any inconsistencies in the dataset. Also create a Date Table in the data model.
2. Data Modeling - Created relationships between the 3 sources - Geo Data, Hotel Bookings, Date Table
3. Visualizations - Created visuals to convey the business performance and evaluation using different market segments, customer types, booking dates, room type and cancellations. 

Additional aspects included:
1. Tool tips for all the KPIs, providing a quick view of their movement over time.
2. Data definitions at the bottom of the reports, for easy understanding of the subject matter and data presented.
3. Page navigators
